Program Description:  This program extends the functionality of assignment 8 by retrieving data from Yahoo Finance.  
Given a list of ticker symbols and a start date, the program retrieves data from Yahoo Finance using its API.  The
data is then written to csv files, one for each stock.  The CSV files are read and the data is compiled into 
a single JSON file that is then used to generate the graph.
